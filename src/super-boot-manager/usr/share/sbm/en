Tutorial: graphic resolution
1) set screen resolution for bootloader using features
   that you can find into Burg-Manager and Grub-Manager
   depending on bootloader in use
2) reboot, access to burg/grub, press c to open shell
   and execute vbeinfo and note vesa code 
   corrisponding to the same resolution used for grub/burg
   (ex. vga=0x0319). Then write "exit" and reboot into Ubuntu.
3) For BURG:
   start burg-manager and set into tab 'Parameters 4'
   field GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX with noted value (es. vga=0x0319)
   and enable into tab 'Parameters 3' GRUB_LINUX16.
   Execute from shell: sudo update-burg.
   Reboot to make sure that Plymouth is displayed 
   correctly.
   For GRUB:
   start grub-manager and set into tab 'Parameters 3'
   field GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX with noted value (es. vga=0x0319)
   and enable into tab 'Parameters 4' GRUB_LINUX16.
   Execute from shell: sudo update-grub.
   Reboot to make sure that Plymouth is displayed 
   correctly.
   If Plymouth isn't displayed correctly you can use the feature 
   that you can find into tab "Proprietary Drivers".
Open
In this tab you can make Plymouth compatible with Proprietary Drivers.
If you're using the open drivers, do not perform this procedure.
In some cases, the method proposed in the tutorial on the first tab does not work
and you must recourse to the method implemented in this tab.
